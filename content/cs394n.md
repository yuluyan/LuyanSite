My research area is computational neuroscience and my background is in physics. I have hidden talents in mathematics. Three potential topics I'd be interested in working on are:

### 1. Spiking neural networks
Spiking neural networks (SNN) go one step further in mimicking the brain than the artificial neural networks (ANN). Instead of all neurons being active at all time, a neuron in SNN is only active when the intrinsic variable, usually called the membrane potential, achieves a certain level. Here are some references of SNN that might be interesting to you:

</a>
- <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10936" class="link-normal" target="_blank">Unsupervised Learning of a Hierarchical SpikingNeural Network for Optical Flow Estimation: From Events to Global Motion Perception</a>


### 2. Applications of machine learning on neurological/biological data

### 3. Other *'traditional'* machine learning problems
I'm also open to other problems that gain enormous interest such as reinforcement learning and so on.


#### I have teamed up with <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~jiahui/neuralnetworkads.html" class="link-normal" target="_blank">Jiahui Liu</a> and we are working on the secure computation of neural networks.
