The virtuosity of the [spiking neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiking_neural_network) in biological brains have always been intriguing to people. Truly, a single neuron is easy to understand. However, when putting an astronomical amount of them together and they start to talk to each other, the complexity quickly go beyond control.

To pave the way of gaining more understanding of such networks, this project focuses on the stochastic modeling of the network. The goal is to develop efficient algorithms that can compute the statistical quantities of any given network without performing simulations.
