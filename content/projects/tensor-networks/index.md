[Tensor networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00006) are widely used in quantum physics for the finding the ground state of a quantum system using variational methods. It reduces the unconquerable large parametric space into tractable small parts, usually with some *interpretable structures* and therefore enables us to develop efficient numerical algorithms to minimize them. 

Not coincidentally, the core of machine learning is all about minimization. Thus, there is a natural motivation for us to borrow the ideas from tensor networks and apply it into machine learning. In this project, we explore the possibility of applying one of the most well known tensor network, [matrix product state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_product_state), to classification problems.
