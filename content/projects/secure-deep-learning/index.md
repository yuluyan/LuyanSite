Deep neural network is perhaps the most popular phrase nowadays. The world is changing because of its power, however, security and privacy issues have come to people's attention. The possibility of leaking private user or server data is intolerable in financial, medical or other sensitive fields.

There are two stages when considering the security issue --- training stage and evaluation stage. In this project, we deal with the latter. The security strategy we use and improve upon is the integer vector [homomorphic encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption) scheme proposed by Zhou and Wornell.
