The contact surface formed by stacking an antiferromagnetic (AFM) and a topological insulator (TI) thin film can be magnetized by external magnetic field. The required strength for flipping the magnetization is determined by the interfacial coupling strengths of specific samples and may vary due to impurity or disorder. 

Therefore, in an AFM/TI/AFM trilayer structure, we expect an antisymmetric magnetoresistance spikes due to the **unsynchronized** magnetic switchings. This is confirmed both theoretically and experimentally.
