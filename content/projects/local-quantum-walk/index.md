[Quantum random walk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_walk) exhibits many unique phenomena compare with the classical version, showing the bizarreness of the quantum world. One such intriguing phenomenon is called *localization*.

In classical case, the probability of finding the random walker dissipates and vanishes as time passes by. However, in a quantum world, there remains a **finite probability** of finding the walker at a certain point no matter how long it goes. In this project, we investigated the localization phenomenon on a honeycomb lattice.

More details can be found in this [published paper](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.92.052305).
