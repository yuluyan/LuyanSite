I'm currently a 5<sup>th</sup> year Ph.D. student in physics at UT Austin receiving <a href="https://ph.utexas.edu/graduate/prospective-graduate-students/financial-support" class="link-normal" target="_blank">Provost's graduate excellence fellowship</a>. Recently, I joined the <a href="https://ctcn.utexas.edu/" class="link-normal" target="_blank">center for theoretical and computational neuroscience</a> as a research assistant under the supervision of <a href="https://mathneuro.cns.utexas.edu/" class="link-normal" target="_blank">Dr. Thibaud Taillefumier</a>. The two main focuses of my interests in the field of computational neuroscience, broadly speaking, are: 

- to understand how the biological neural networks actually work; and
- to inspire the development and improvement of neural-network-based machine learning algorithms.

<a href="{{< ref "projects" >}}" class="link-normal" style="font-weight:bold;">Here's a list of my past and ongoing projects.</a>    

I use mathematical tools such as stochastic calculus and functional differential equation to study the behavior and extract properties of neural networks; and tropical algebra to study problems in bioinformatics such as phylogenetic trees. Meanwhile, for the second part, I'm also looking into the optimization over tensor networks that has a wide range of applications emerging in machine learning.
 
I enjoy using computational tools to solve problems either from research or in life. As a passionate believer and active advocate of <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/" class="link-normal mma" target="_blank">Wolfram Mathematica</a>, I use it almost daily for research and pleasure. I also use (C++ | Python | Rust) when they best suit my needs. I'm also into parallel computing, more specifically, CUDA for GPU computing. test
