I'm currently a 3<sup>rd</sup> year Ph.D. student in physics at UT Austin receiving [Provost's graduate excellence fellowship](https://ph.utexas.edu/graduate/prospective-graduate-students/financial-support). Recently, I joined the [center for theoretical and computational neuroscience](https://ctcn.utexas.edu/) as a research assistant under the supervision of [Dr. Thibaud Taillefumier](https://mathneuro.cns.utexas.edu/). The two main focuses of my interests in the field of computational neuroscience, broadly speaking, are: 

- to understand how the biological neural networks actually work; and
- to inspire the development and improvement of neural-network-based machine learning algorithms.
    
[Here is a list of my past and ongoing projects.]({{< ref "projects" >}})

I use mathematical tools such as: stochastic calculus and functional differential equation to study the behavior and extract properties of neural networks; and tropical algebra to study problems in bioinformatics such as phylogenetic trees. Meanwhile, for the second part, I'm also looking into the optimization over tensor networks that has a wide range of applications emerging in machine learning.
 
I enjoy using computational tools to solve problems either from reseach, or in life. As a passionate believer and active advocate of <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/" class="link-normal mma" target="_blank">Wolfram Mathematica</a>, I use it almost daily for research and pleasure. I also use (C++ | Python | Rust) when they best suit the needs. I'm also into parallel computing, more specifically, CUDA for GPU computing. As a side hobby, I causually do some front-end web developing; for example, this site and <a href="https://github.com/yuluyan/TheNote" class="link-black" target="_blank">TheNote</a>.
