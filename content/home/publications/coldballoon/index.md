abstract: "A balloon will cool down as air escapes from inside. This article establishes a model that explains its causes in detail from the perspective of continuum mechanics and thermodynamics. The cooling of the balloon is primarily attributed to the work done by the rubber sheet during its contraction process. Subsequently, a series of experiments and simulations are also carried out, which show good consistency with the theory."
