abstract: "The set of ultrametrics that are $l^\\infty$-nearest to a given dissimilarity map forms a $(\\max,+)$ tropical polytope. In this paper, we present the exterior description of such tropical polytope which enables us to use the exterior to interior description conversion algorithm to compute its extreme rays (tropical vertices). Further, the sufficiency of the extremality characterization in is proved for the case $n=3$ where $n$ is the cardinality of the leaf set. On the other hand, an inductive construction of counterexamples is given to disprove the sufficiency for any $n \\geq 4$."
